name: use Cabal in CI

  Currently the CI just executes 'nix build' to compile the project.

  This is extremely short and easy to setup, but it has, IMHO, two main
  drawbacks:

  - it is hard to debug, when something unexpected happen (e.g.
  https://github.com/tweag/crem/issues/64).
  - it constraints (or at least it defaults) to the version of the packages
  present on `nixpkgs`.

  Given that we are testing a library, it would be nice to check as many
  combinations of tools (e.g. `GHC` and `cabal`) and dependency versions as
  possible.
decision: >
  We decided to replace `Nix` with `cabal` for `CI` purposes.

  This new setup allows to test on different platforms, `GHC` versions, `cabal`
  versions and set of dependencies.
consequences: >
  We rewrote our CI to use `cabal`.

  Now not every dependency is fixed as it was on `Nix` so it might happen that
  `CI` breaks unexpectedly. That could be seen as a good thing, since it could
  be something which happens to an end user.
