name: Use single line haddock comments
date: 2023-01-12
context: >
  We would like to document the project extensively, creating proper
  documentation for all datatypes and functions defined in the project.

  [Haddock](https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io) is a tool that converts code comments to documentation.
  It supports two styles of comments:

  - single-line: `-- |`

  - multi-line: `{- |`

  Haddock also offers "doctests" to automatically run the examples
  included in the Haddock documentation. Such examples are defined using the
  `>>>` syntax inside Haddock comments.

  The [Haskell Language Server](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io)
  can directly execute doctest comments, but only if they are single-line.
decision: >
  We will use single-line comments so that examples can be executed by HLS and
  recognised as doctests
consequences: >
  We configure [Fourmolu](https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu) to use
  single-line comments and use it to enforce this style.
