name: Remove initialState field
date: 2023-01-13
context: >
  A [Mealy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) is usually
  described by an evolution function `s -> a -> (b, s)` and an
  `initialState :: s`.

  The initial state is useful only we actually need to run the state machine,
  not to understand the topology of the state machine.

  Removing the initial state from the definition, we are left with a stateless
  definition of a process which consumes inputs of type `a` and produces
  outputs of type `b`. This implies that what we have at hand is a category!
decision: >
  We decide to move the `initialState` out of the state machine definition, and
  pass it instead when the machine is actually run.
consequences: >
  The `BaseMachine` data type loses the `initialState` field and all the
  examples machines do not define it.

  This will also allow the implementation of an instance of the `Category` type
  class.
