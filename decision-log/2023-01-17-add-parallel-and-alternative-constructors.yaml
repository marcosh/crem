name: Add Parallel and Alternative constructors
date: 2023-01-17
context: >
  Mealy machine, at least in theory, admit an instance for `Strong` and
  `Choice` type classes, to allow parallel and alternative composition.

  In our current implementation, we could implement `Strong` and `Choice` just
  by forwarding the composition to the `BaseMachine` layer.

  Still everytime that we are combining two state machine, either sequentially,
  in parallel or in alternative, the set of states is always the cartesian
  product of the sets of states. It follows that we would not be able to
  understand which constructor we used just by looking at the topology.
decision: >
  We decide to add specific constructors for parallel and alternative
  composition.
consequences: >
  We will be able to keep track of how a state machine is built.

  Moreover we will be able to draw not only the set of spaces with allowed
  transitions, but also a
  [wiring diagram](https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/informatics/talks/WD-IntroductoryTalk.pdf)
  representing the flow of information through the machine.
