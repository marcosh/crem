  The topology of a state machine lists its allowed transitions.

  Sometimes (like in the implementation of the `Choice` typeclass) we would
  simply like to say that we are not changing state. This is still seen as a
  transition by our current implementation.
decision: >
  We will always consider not changing state as a valid transition.
consequences: >
  We create a new instance of our `AllowedTransition` typeclass which searches
  for a proof term indicating that a transition is allowed. Such an instance
  says that going from a vertex to itself in the space of the states of the
  machine is always allowed.

  This implies that it is not necessary to specify in a topology that every
  trivial transition is allowed.
